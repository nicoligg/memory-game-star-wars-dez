# *Project Overview*

The "Memory Game: Star Wars" is a web-based game that challenges your memory while immersing you in the Star Wars universe. This project is a work in progress and is part of the October Automation Team Challenge.


# *Features*
Piano has the following features:

1. *Card Matching:* In the "Memory Game: Star Wars," you are presented with a grid of cards. Each card contains an image of a character or element from the Star Wars franchise. Your goal is to match cards with identical images by flipping them over.

2. *Timer:* The game includes a timer that keeps track of how long it takes you to complete it. Compete against the clock to test your memory skills.

3. *Interactive Play:*  You can interact with the game in the following ways:

- Click on a card to flip it over and reveal the image.
- Attempt to match two cards with the same image.
- If the cards match, they remain face up; otherwise, they flip back over.
- Click on 

4. *Scoring:* Your performance is scored based on how quickly you can match all the cards. Challenge yourself to improve your memory and beat your previous scores.

5. *Play with Music:* Start the game by clicking the "Play" button, and you'll be immediately immersed in the Star Wars universe with iconic background music. Feel like a true Jedi as you test your memory skills.
